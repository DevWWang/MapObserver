# Map Observer

Map generator applies the observer pattern, which all the observers are notified when there is a change to the subject. <br/>
In this project, map is the subject. The changes include _setting map size, initializing map, building path, placing towers, and starting critters_. <br/>
The MapDisplay class, the observer, is presentation of the map design which prints out each change done to the map.
