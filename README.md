# Map Observer

Map generator applies the observer pattern, which all the observers are notified when there is a change to the subject. <br/>
In this project, map is the subject. The changes include setting map size, initializing map, building path, placing towers, and starting critters.
The MapDisplay class, the observer, is presentation of the map design which prints out each change done to the map.
